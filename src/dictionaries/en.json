While complaining is often the go-to defense mechanism for most humans when faced with diversity, perceived inequality or frankly anything – it is utterly pointless when confronting one’s inner voice.\n\nIt’s time to Come Plain, we’re just one and the same. We just fill in the blanks. Would you like to donate to the latest and greatest endless campaign?"

This track is a follow up to COME PLAIN and another collaboration between Non-essential Workers and the captivating Krakow-based singer Namena Lala.\n\nEvery human has an infinite number of stories to tell. TELLTALE is a journey inside one of those  stories wrapped up in a multi-narrative song. It is an excavation of memories of a love story that never was, and an attempt to understand both sides of why it could never be.\n\nWhile the electronic and trip-hop soundscapes of the single might be familiar territory for Non-Essential Workers, TELLTALE explores new thematic lyrical ground by examining a relationship through the prism of both travel and time. Almost immediately listeners are thrust into the middle of a Central European discotheque – a medieval cellar with flashing neon lights – and are invited to dance along as the tale unfolds.\n\n“It’s not about the he said she said, it’s all about the journey instead.“"
