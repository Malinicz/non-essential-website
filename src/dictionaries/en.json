While complaining is often the go-to defense mechanism for most humans when faced with diversity, perceived inequality or frankly anything – it is utterly pointless when confronting one’s inner voice.\n\nIt’s time to Come Plain, we’re just one and the same. We just fill in the blanks. Would you like to donate to the latest and greatest endless campaign?"
